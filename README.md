# Deep-learning-game-model
In this model, Convolutional deep learning technique is used to figure out the winner in a rock,paper,scissor game. 
Also the output of the model i.e (which player wins) is conveyed to the user via speech from the computer using win32api.
the model is static as it doesnt continuosly produces results but it tends to capture the focused areas and then predict the output.
